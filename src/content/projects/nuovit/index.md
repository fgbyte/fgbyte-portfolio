**Nuovit Layouts**

This project focused on developing responsive HTML layouts for **Nuovit.com**, a real estate content website. The goal was to create clean, modern, and user-friendly interfaces for showcasing real estate listings and related content.

**Tech Stack**:
- Built with **HTML** for structure, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for added functionality.
- The layouts were designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Emphasis was placed on creating a visually appealing and intuitive user experience for potential buyers and sellers.
-  The use of Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid development and easy customization of the layouts.

This project showcases my ability to translate design concepts into functional and responsive web interfaces, while adhering to best practices for web development.
