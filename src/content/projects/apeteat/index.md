**Apeteat Layouts**

This project involved creating the foundational HTML layouts for Apeteat, a platform focused on food-related content and services. The goal was to design a series of visually appealing and user-friendly templates to support the project's diverse content needs.

**Tech Stack**:
- Developed using **HTML** for the structure and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- The focus was on creating a responsive design that would ensure a consistent experience across various devices.
- The layouts were designed to be easily adaptable to different types of content, from blog posts to product listings.
- The utilization of Tailwind CSS enabled a rapid development process and ensured design consistency across the project.

This project highlights my ability to craft clean, functional, and responsive web layouts using modern web development practices.
