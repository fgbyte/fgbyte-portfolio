**Storybook Component Library**

This project involved the creation of a reusable component library using Storybook, built to facilitate collaborative development and maintain consistency across the Aquavia Spa website.

**Tech Stack**:

- Developed using **HTML**, **SCSS**, and **TypeScript** for a robust and maintainable codebase.
- **Storybook** was used to create an interactive development environment, allowing for easy component visualization and testing.
- This library promotes code reuse and ensures a consistent user experience throughout the Aquavia Spa web presence.
- The components were designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, meeting a range of design needs.

This project demonstrates my ability to create component-based systems that enhance development efficiency and code quality.
